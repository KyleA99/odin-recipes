# odin-recipes
This is my first HTML project, which contains three basic recipes one can read and utilize.  Through my learning and participation in The Odin Project, I was able to gain baseline information in HTML that allowed me to create this project.

Through the creation of this project I gained exposure to a variety of HTML elements and attributes, including links, images, paragraphs, links, etc.  This project also increased my exposure to git commands, git syntax, and the Unix Shell CLI.

As of now, the project is very basic.  However, as I gain knowledge and exposure of CSS, this project will become more visually appealing.
